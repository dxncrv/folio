## Overview

**Challenges:** Our team, Skyfall, was tasked with building an iOS product and working with TestFlight. We analyzed the previous prototype and decided to reprogram the application from scratch. Additionally, we developed a user data metrics collection module to store data in an online database.  

**My Roles:** I served as Project Manager, Scrum Master, and 3D & UX Designer. My primary responsibilities were project management and Scrum duties, but I also contributed to art, design, and implementation whenever possible.

**Goals:**  
1. Build a scalable iOS application for iPad Minis.  
2. Develop the backend module for collecting data.  
3. Conduct a usability test round to iterate on controls and UI.

**The Result:**

- A fully voice-acted Prologue for setting the context.
- Three playable characters with different genders and ethnicities.
- A back-end data collection module.
- Three different user groups assigned by the game, each providing feedback at different levels.
- A detailed storyline with five possible conclusions.
- Questing, item descriptions, and item processing using a computer and microscope.
- Submitting evidence reports to Ada Lovelace with a text field for additional comments.
- Tested usability of features and iterated based on insights gained.
- Eight animated NPCs, a fully developed environment, minimap, big map, quest description panels, ambient sound, zone names, and more.

## Other Contributions

Besides facilitating client meetings, weekly Scrum management, sprint planning, UX wireframes, and documentation, I also contributed by storyboarding, creating 3D assets in Blender, and developing systems in Unity.

After our first client meeting, I created this prologue prototype in the second week of the project to kick off the storyline narrative. This helped us raise questions and address key aspects of the project early on.

I designed and implemented three of these characters from scratch in Unity, using Mixamo for rigging and the standard third-person controller for animations. I also conceptualized and modeled the science station shown below.
