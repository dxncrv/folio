## Cross Cultural Impact Jam

I participated in an Impact Jam hosted by Games for Change. The theme of the jam was 'Amplifying voices' and the challenge was to create a game that would help amplify the voices of people who are often misunderstood. I was in a team of 4 students, each from a different country, and we created a game called 'Healing Heart' in 10 days.

Our team secured the honorable mention for the most creative game. The game was featured on play.unity.com and raked in 3,000 views and 2,000 plays.

## Goal and Alignment

Our goal was to create a game that encourages people to be more empathetic towards people whose speech is affected by a strong emotional state. The game has a fun mechanism which allows players to align their listening skills with the emotional state of the speaker, which when done successfully, the speaker appears human again.

This game aims to amplify the voices of the people who feel alienated because their speech is highly vulnerable to strong emotions like anxiety, insecurity or sadness. And Healing Heart promotes the message of shifting the bias with empathetic listening and conditioning the use of kind words in these situations.
